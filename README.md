#KANBAN-BOARD#
This project involves creating a dynamic Kanban board using React.js, designed to display and manage tickets fetched from a provided API. Users can group tickets based on their status, assigned user, or priority and sort them by priority (in descending order) or title (in ascending order).

The application ensures a seamless user experience by dynamically updating the board based on the selected grouping and sorting options. Additionally, user preferences are saved using localStorage, ensuring the selected view persists even after a page reload. The board is built to be responsive and visually aligns with the provided design specifications for a clean and interactive UI.
